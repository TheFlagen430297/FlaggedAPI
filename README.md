<h1>What is FlaggedAPI? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h1>
<p><b>FlaggedAPI is a All-In-One API to connect to most of my services :D</b><br>It is a small API right now & only has an cuss checker and a logging system.<br>but it will receive updates whenever I can get around to it üòÉ
<br>
All functions should have JSDoc! It's when you hover over a function in VSCode and it gives you information about it :D
It includes a description, and code inside of it :D 100% Help in the function itself XD</p>
<br>
<br><h2>Important Announcements!</h2>
<br><p>Major version 3.0.0 completely changes how the code works and how it is written! You will have to update your code.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1>3.2.0 Update</h1>
Better coded consoleControl(); and updated the README.md file *(Sorry)*
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><i>Don't forget that all the documentation is found when hovering the functions in VSCode!</i>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Required and Recommended Settings</h1>
<p>Here is what the requiring of the code looks like</p>    

```js
//This is the demo code, it has a lot of possibilities. ü§£

//Most, if not all functions/values have the JSDoc in VSCode. To see it do this:
//‚Ä¢ Call the API: const FlaggedAPI = require("flaggedapi");
//‚Ä¢ Use the logger (Or any function really): FlaggedAPI.log()
//‚Ä¢ Hover over the .log() part!
//It should display detailed help üòÅ If however it does not display correctly or you still need help, go to https://discord.gg/b9ax4KJ and join the Discord server!


//Normal Operations:
//These are used to call and create the shortcut calls of the API.

//Calling the API.
const { ACD, ACDClear, ACDToggle, chalk, check, clear, colors, list, log, supported, consoleControl } = require("flaggedapi");

//Now all you have to use is:
//‚Ä¢ ACD();
//‚Ä¢ log();
//‚Ä¢ ACDClear();


//Always need set:

//Allows you to toggle ACD (Advanced Console Debugging).
//If toggled True: You will see ACD messages and ACDClear() will not run
//REMEMBER THAT ACDToggle(true) MUST BE SET TO TRUE TO SEE THE MESSAGES!
//as of 1.3.0 you no longer need to set a boolean in the function, it will toggle it's state.
ACDToggle(/*Default is: false*/); //This will set it to True because it was False, if ran again, it will set it to False.

//Allows you to toggle Supported Console.
//If toggled True: You will see all log messages in color!
//If toggled False: No coloring will be used!
//MOST CONSOLES PROPERLY SUPPORT COLORS! Only use this option if you need too :)
supported(/*Default is: true*/); //This will set it to False because it was True, if ran again, it will set it to True.

//Allows you to set the colors for all of the ACL & ACD logging.
//It must be hard-coded and ran every time at startup.
//However it can also be ran at any point in time to change the color.
//It must follow this example: ([`Color_ID`, `Hex Value`], [`Main_Color`, `#FF0000`]).
colors([`Text_Color_Debug`, `#F0e0a0`], [`Main_Color`, `#FF0000`], [`Text_Color_Main`, `#F0e0a0`]);

//Lists the current color settings.
colors();
```

    <summary><h2>No Notes Version</h2></summary>

```js
const { ACD, ACDClear, ACDToggle, chalk, check, clear, colors, list, log, supported } = require("flaggedapi");
ACDToggle();
supported(); 
colors([`Text_Color_Debug`, `#F0e0a0`], [`Main_Color`, `#FF0000`], [`Text_Color_Main`, `#F0e0a0`]);
colors();
```
</details>
<br>
<br>
<h1>ACL <i>(Advanced Console Logging)</i></h1>
<p>It makes the console more customizable</p>

```js
//Normal functions:

//Clears the console if ACDToggle() is False.
ACDClear();

//Logs strings to the console!
//Now supports Integers, Booleans, Objects, Arrays or anything else!
 
//Use the log()
log(); //=>*Nothing*
 
log(``); //=>*Nothing*
      
log(` `); //=> (!) 

log(`Test`); //=> (!) Test
 
log({ Some: `Object`}); //=> (!) { Some: `Object`}

log(`Logging with\nmore then\n\none line!`); //=>
//(!) Logging with
// ‚ï†‚ïê more then
// ‚ïë  
// ‚ïö‚ïê one line!

log(`Test`, { color: "#FF0000", type: "info" }); //=> (!) Info: Test
//*The text will be Red, and it will append "Info:"*
//The Info color will be what you have set it in colors()

log(`Test`, { returnRaw: true, bold: true, italic: true, underline: true, color: "#FF0000" }); //=> chalk.hex(#424742).bold(` (`) + chalk.hex(#047ffa).bold(`!`) + chalk.hex(#424742).bold(`) `) + chalk.hex(`#FF0000`).bold.italic.underline("Test")
//*It will return the raw chalk format for processing*
//This is a string value that you will need to have processed, it will not log.

log(`Test`, { returnRaw: false, bold: true, italic: true, underline: true, color: "#FF0000" }); //=> (!) Test
//*It will be Bold, Italic, Underlined, and the text will be Red*
//It will log to the console.
//In this case, all of these options are optional.

log(`Test`, { returnRaw: true, color: "#FF0000", type: "info" }).then(data => console.log(data)); //=> chalk.hex(#424742).bold.italic(` (`) + chalk.hex(#e3ca1c).bold.italic(`!`) + chalk.hex(#424742).bold.italic(`) `) + chalk.hex(#e3ca1c).italic.bold(`Info: `) + chalk.hex(#FF0000).italic(This is a test!)
//*It will return the raw chalk format for processing*
```

<br>
<h1>ACD <i>(Advanced Console Debugging)</i></h1>
<p>It makes it easier to send error or success messages to the console</p>

```js
//Normal functions:

//Logs to the console!

//The "success" part can be one of four values: "success", "info", "warning", "error"
ACD("You are reading the README.md help file!", "success");//=> (!) Success: You are reading the README.md help file!
```
<details>
    <summary><h2>No Notes Version</h2></summary>

```js
ACD("You are reading the README.md help file!", "success");
```
</details>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Console Control</h1>
<p>Now you can control the console and add your own custom commands to it!</p>

```js
//Any packages or variables that you have in your code
const somepkg = require(`somepkg`);
let somestr = `This is an example`;

//Calling the function will make FlaggedAPI take over the console.
//IMPORTANT! You MUST pass the root dir path into the function, if you call the function from another file, you must pass the root dir.
consoleControl(__dirname, { somepkg, somestr });
```
<details>
    <summary><h2>No Notes Version</h2></summary>

```js
const somepkg = require(`somepkg`);
let somestr = `This is an example`;
consoleControl(__dirname, { somepkg, somestr });
```
</details>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Cuss Check ‚úÖ</h1>
<p>This part of the code checks and sees if the inputted string match's one of the over 182+ cuss words!</p>

```js
//Cuss Checking
 
//Use check()
check(`Doesn't matter, frick you nerd, you piece of crap`, { custom_words: [`nerd`], ignored_words: [`Words`, `You`, `Don't`, `Want`, `Checked`, `Crap`], level: 4 }).then(data => {
  console.log(data); //=>
  //{
  //    number_of_words: 2,
  //    words: [
  //      {
  //        cussword: 'frick',
  //        language: 'english',
  //        level: 4,
  //        reference: 'https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Frick',
  //        origin: 'api'
  //      },
  //      { cussword: 'nerd', level: 1, origin: 'custom' }
  //    ]
  //}
})

//Gives you a list of all the cuss words. (This is just for you to view the words in it's Array format. Use the method below to get the actual Array for processing)
list().then(data => {
    console.log(data)
})
```
